# Airbnb-Price-in-NYC

### Purpose
The year 2020 has been different from any other years due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the pandemic, there has been a huge crisis on travel, hotel and airbnb industry. This crisis caused fear to majority of the people. People are scared of traveling or even stepping one step outside of house. Moreover, the government regulation of traveling, by closing majority of the stores and preventing international travel significantly affected the usage of airbnb or hotels.
Many businesses in different locations got negative impact, including the Airbnb - an American vacation rental business. As other cities, one of the most populated cities, New York, wasn't exception. New York has became a much more quiet city than before. 
As this situation is still going on and unpredictable, the interest came from the desire to travel around. Plus, just like us, there are lots of people who are seeking freedom of traveling due to such special circumstances. Wishing the situation gets better, our team has broke down the data to analyze the relationship between the price and other factors.
